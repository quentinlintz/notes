### Chapter 13: Persia

> The scenes of our youth, like the past, are always beautiful if we do not have to live in them again (p. 350)

Deioces was the first king of Medes--later Persia.

During Cyrus' reign, the Persian empire consisted of Assyria, Babylonia, Lydia, and Asia Minor.

Under Darius, Persia had 20 provinces--never before had history recorded such an extensive area brough under one government.

Gold and silver "daries" were issued as currency and stamped with the features of Darius. The gold-to-silver ratio was 13.5 to 1.

Christmas was originally a solar festival celebrating the triumph of the sun over his enemies. It was a Mithraic holy day.

> It is in the nature of an empire to disintegrate soon, for the energy that created it disappears from those who inherit it, at the very time its subject peoples are gathering strength to fight for their lost liberty (p. 382)
