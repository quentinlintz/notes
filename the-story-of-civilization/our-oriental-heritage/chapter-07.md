### Chapter 7: Sumeria

The region of Elam (central city of Susa) was the oldest appearance of the potter's wheel and the wagon wheel (4500 BC)

In 2300 BC Sumerian poets and scholars tried to reconstruct their ancient history. They wrote of a creation, Paradise, and terrible flood that destroyed the Paradise doe to the sin of an ancient king. This was passed down to Babylonia and Hebrew tradition. There is evidence of a catastrophic overflow of the Euphrates which lingered in later memory of the flood.

Sargon I of Akkad conquered Elam and western Asia, creating the world's first great empire in history.

Lagash's monarch--Gudea-- was devoted to religion, literature, and good works.
