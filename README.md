## notes

I'm an erudite. The best way for me to remember everything I read is to take notes by hand. Some evenings I copy those notes from my [LEUCHTTURM1917](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/) or [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/) notebook to this GitHub repo and make it available as a GitHub Page for easier navigation and reference.
